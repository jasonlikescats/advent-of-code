# AdventOfCode2020

## Overview
Solutions here are for the problems at: https://adventofcode.com/2020

## Instructions
Developed and tested using Crystal 0.35.1:
```
$ crystal -v
Crystal 0.35.1 [5999ae29b] (2020-06-19)

LLVM: 8.0.0
Default target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

For each day, running `main.cr` should output the results (though input
files have not been committed, so you'll need to supply your own).
