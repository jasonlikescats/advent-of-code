# Advent of Code 2019

## Overview

Solutions are in Ruby, though I can't remember what version.
Given the timeline, it's likely Ruby 2.6. I was learning Ruby
on the fly though, so there's nothing too exotic; it'll probably
run fine much further back than 2.6.

## Usage

Each day has a `main.rb` script that will output both part 1 & 2
solutions when run (provided `input.txt` exists in the directory
alongside the script).
